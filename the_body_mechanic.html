  <h3>The challenge</h3>

<p>As a new massage therapist, Stephanie wanted to launch her massage business with a professional website. She also needed a logo made to match the stock logo she used from an online business card site.</p><br>

<h3>The solution<br></h3>

<p>A logo was created to match Stephanie's business card. Her site also featured modern conveniences such as online scheduling. Stephanie was able to establish trust and project professionalism with her new client-centered website. </p>

 <div class="portfolio-text">
    <p>By incorporating the Square online scheduler into her website, clients are able to schedule appointments at their convenience.</p>

    <h4>Online forms</h4>
  </div>
  <div class="portfolio-text">
    <p>Squarespace has integrated electronic forms, but Stephanie had a physical form that had to be filled out the old fashioned way - with a pen. So instead of a digital form, her site features a PDF form for her clients to print and fill out before their appointment.</p>
