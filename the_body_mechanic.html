  <strong><h4>The challenge</h4></strong>

<p>Our client wanted to launch her new massage business with a professional website. She also needed a logo made to match the stock logo she used from an online business card site.</p><br>

<h4><strong>The solution</strong><br></h4>

<p>We created the logo to match her business card, and incorporated smart options within her website such as online scheduling. Stephanie was able to establish trust and project professionalism with her new client-centered website. </p>

  <h4>third-party software integration</h4>

 <div class="portfolio-text">
    <p>We embedded our client's Square online scheduler into her website. This feature allows clients to schedule appointments at their convenience.</p>

    <h4>online forms</h4>
  </div>
  <div class="portfolio-text">
    <p>While Squarespace allows for electronic forms, our client had a physical form that had content not possible to emulate digitally.  Instead we were able to upload the PDF for her clients to print and fill out before their appointment.</p>
