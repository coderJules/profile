  <strong><h4>The challenge</h4></strong>

<p>Our client's ten year old business is experiencing a season of rapid expansion. Jason needed to automate his manual processes, currently executed on excel macros. He also required a system that could be managed by future employees as he expands. His customer facing site was currently a management software template site, and needed a facelift.</p><br>

<h4><strong>The solution</strong><br></h4>

<p>To save time, and reduce human error, we created two application tools. The first is a property comp tool that allows Jason to quickly control for custom factors and compare properties in the local area of 300,000+ properties. The second is a rehab cost estimator tool. We uploaded his spreadsheet of itemized costs, and automated his home evaluation process. His business has been growing for 10 years, so we updated his logo and gave his public facing website a facelift to reflect the success of his company and made it feel more modern.</p>

    <p>The application takes the subject parcel number and a mileage radius to compare homes near it. Certain categories are adjustable, like square footage.</p>

    <p>The search results and subject property are displayed on google maps. Depending on location, it may be decided to discard a property from the comparable evaluation.</p>

  <div class="portfolio-text">
    <p>The list of search results gives comparable property infomation, as well as a google map image of the property. If a property is not a good fit for evaluation the user may uncheck it and recalculate the comparable value estimate.</p>

  <div class="portfolio-text">
    <p>The information gleaned from the program gets the average cost per square foot of all applicable comps. This value is then applied to the subject property square footage, offering an estimated value of the subject property.</p>
