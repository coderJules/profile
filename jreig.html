  <strong><h4>The challenge</h4></strong>

<p>Our client's ten year old business was experiencing a season of rapid expansion. Jason needed automation of his manual processes, previously implemented through Excel macros. The growth of his business necessitated a  system that could be used and managed by his whole team. And finally, his customer facing site was built on a basic template and needed a facelift.  </p><br>

<h4><strong>The solution</strong><br></h4>

<p>To save time and reduce human error, we created two applications:</p><br>
<p class="indent">The first; a property comparison tool that allows Jason and his team to quickly compare properties in the local area of 300,000+ residences, controlling for custom factors.</p>
<p class="indent">And second, a cost estimator tool that automates the home evaluation process based on a configurable database of itemized costs.</p><br>
<p>To modernize his now 10 year old business, we also updated his logo and public facing website to reflect the success of his burgeoning company.</p>

Calculations are generated once the linear and square feet are added and item quantities are entered. The application outputs the total cost of each item, room and house. For usability, a circle icon helps keep track of what rooms still need data, and which are complete.</p> -->
