<h3>The challenge</h3>

<p>When the client reached out for assistance, he had already started a Squarespace site. He quickly realized he did not have the time to finish it himself. He needed a site that promoted his personal brand, highlighted his experience and demonstrated his value.</p><br>

<h3>The solution<br></h3>

<p>The site design is centered around the professional photos Ryan had commissioned. The result is a place for visitors to not only find the services they need, but also get a feel for Ryan himself. The photographs convey exactly how Ryan is in real life; optimistic, full of energy and ready to help others. Also reinforced is his experience with a blog space, testimonials and video.</p>

  <h4>Photo editing</h4>
</div>
 <div class="portfolio-text">
    <p>Wanting to showcase Ryan's public speaking photos as a backdrop for his site, proved challenging. The photos had problems with color and composition and corrective editing only further diminished the quality. As a solution, Ryan's silhouette was cut from an image and placed on a solid blue background. The result is a impactful banner image. Ryan is in shown in action, while the simple blue backdrop allows the white text to pop without anything in the background from being too distracting.
