  <strong><h4>The challenge</h4></strong>

<p>When our client reached out for us for help, he had already started a Squarespace site. He quickly realized he did not have the time to finish it himself. He needed a site that promoted his personal brand, highlighted his experience and demonstrated his value.</p><br>

<h4><strong>The solution</strong><br></h4>

<p>We designed a site centered around the professional photos Ryan had commissioned. The result is a place for visitors to not only find the services they need, but also get a feel for Ryan himself. The photographs convey exactly how Ryan is in real life; optimistic, full of energy and ready to help others. We also reinforced his experience with a blog space, testimonials and video.</p>

  <h4>Photo editing</h4>
</div>
 <div class="portfolio-text">
    <p>Wanting to showcase Ryan's public speaking photos as a backdrop for his site, proved challenging. The photos had problems with color and composition and corrective editing only further diminished the quality. As a solution, Ryan's silhouette was cut from an image and placed on a solid blue background. The result is a impactful banner image. Ryan is in shown in action, while the simple blue backdrop allows the white text to pop without anything in the background from being too distracting.

    <p>Our client is an avid reader and recommends books to website visitors. We used Amazon seller links for the books he recommends. If he decides to register as an Amazon Associate, he will receive a percentage of the sale anytime someone makes a purchase through his link.
